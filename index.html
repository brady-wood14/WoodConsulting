    <p><strong>Brady Wood</strong><br><br>
    I’ve led 30-mile backpacking trips through freezing rain in Ouachita National Forest and Big Bend National Park, constructed cost models for multimillion-dollar energy plants, and built a simulated human circulatory system for cardiac research — all before finishing my undergrad.
    <br><br>
    I am a rising senior Mechanical Engineering student at Texas A&M, incoming MBA candidate, and aspiring strategy consultant. My experience ranges from bridging cross-cultural teams between France and America, to helping old lady’s cross the street. I have never turned down a problem solving opportunity before, and I don’t intend on doing so now.
    <br><br>
    This summer, I launched an independent consulting initiative in Minneapolis to help local businesses improve operations, customer experience, and growth strategies. I bring the same discipline and drive I’ve applied on mountain-tops, in research labs, and in the office to every client I work with.
    <br><br>
    My goal: help you reach your business goals no matter how big or small.
    <br><br>
    ALL FOR FREE
